        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>M.J Cole is a British music producer, performing artist, and D.J. I have chosen him for this project as one of my favorite artists because he is someone I grew up listening to and he introduced me to new fields of music</p>

        <P>He is a pioneer in a couple of genres of music, in particular UK 2-step garage in the 1990s. He still puts out new music today, testing out new styles and working with a wide range of vocalists and producers.</P>
        <aside>
            <p>Garage in most dialects of British English is pronounced quite differently than American English, with an emphasis on the first syllable. It sounds more akin to "GAIR-ridge."</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <h3>Late 90s - Breakout of UK garage</h3>
        <p>M.J. Cole first started out in technical production and sound engineering of drum and bass tracks in the mid-90s. From there he was introduced to garage music, in particular UK 2-step garage. He was attracted to this upbeat, fresh urban style of electronic music, and by the late 90s was the lead sound engineer at garage music labels.</p>
        <p>In 1998, he produced and released the single <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=02KRAshCG0w&pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD" aria-label="YouTube video of MJ Cole's Sincere">Sincere</a>, which became one of the first garage records to break the mainstream Top 40 in the UK.</p>
        <!--not sure exactly how the aria tags work, but recommended by Lighthouse-->
        <h3>Early 2000s - Growth and success</h3>
        <p>Cole released his first album, also named Sincere, to chart success and critical acclaim. Several singles hit UK and European radio and his videos and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG-rAxNrwSI" aria-label="MJ Cole's live performance of Crazy Love on Jools Holland">live performances</a> hit TV. He was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize (best UK album) and a Brit Award (UK equivalent of the Grammys).</p>
        <h3>2010s-present - Bending genres</h3>
        <p>Throughout his career, Cole collaborated with a range of musicians, and in the 2000s and 2010s, he increasingly leaned into genres like grime, which had a harder, more intense sound from the streets of his hometown, London. Through his collaborations with up-and-coming artists like Wiley and AJ Tracey, he added his stamp and his sound to other genres of music outside of what he was well known for.
        <aside><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/The_London_Sessions.jpg" alt="Cover of Mary J. Blige's The London Sessions">
        <p>Cole was one of the producers chosen by Mary J. Blige to collaborate with on her project and album, The London Sessions. For this project, she moved for London for an extented period to explore new ideas in music and refresh her outlook on music. Together they produced the song, Nobody But You.  </aside>
        </p>
        <p>Cole continues to produce and release tracks of all types of music, from his upbeat, original 2-step sound, to the rough and tumble sounds of grime, to more experimental, almost orchestral compisitions.
